This example shows how to use registerClass with Flash Communication Server/Flash Media Server/Adobe Media Server
to send custom typed AS objects between client and server 

You need Flash CS5 or above to open the FLA.
	
Instructions: 
1) Create a new app on FMS, upload the main.asc file into the newly created app folder 
(this example uses the name registerClass for the app).
2) Modify the connection string (rtmp address) to reflect your server's location and app name.
3) Run it
